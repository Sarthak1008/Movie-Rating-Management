# Movie-Rating-Management
Movie Rating Management project using SpringBoot

The movie rating management project using microservices, Spring Boot, and Eureka server is a software solution that allows users to manage and rate movies. The project is based on a microservices architecture, which means that it is composed of small, independent, and loosely coupled services that work together to achieve the project's goals.

Eureka server is a service registry that allows microservices to discover and communicate with each other.

In this project, the movie rating management system is composed of multiple microservices that work together to achieve the project's goals. These microservices include:

Movie Service: This microservice is responsible for managing movie data, such as movie titles, descriptions, and release dates.

Rating Service: This microservice is responsible for managing movie ratings, such as user ratings and reviews.

User Service: This microservice is responsible for managing user data, such as user profiles, authentication, and authorization.

All the microservices are registered with the Eureka server, which provides a service registry and discovery mechanism for the microservices. The Gateway Service uses the Eureka server to locate and route requests to the appropriate microservice.The project is implemented using Spring Boot, which provides a wide range of features and tools to build and deploy microservices. The microservices communicate with each other using RESTful APIs, which are simple and lightweight.

Overall, the movie rating management project using microservices, Spring Boot, and Eureka server is a scalable and flexible solution that allows users to manage and rate movies with ease.
